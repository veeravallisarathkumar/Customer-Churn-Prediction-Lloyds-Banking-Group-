# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction – Lloyds Banking Group

This repository contains my solution for the **Customer Churn Prediction** project as part of the **Lloyds Banking Group Virtual Experience Program on Forage**. The goal of this project is to analyze customer data, predict which customers are likely to churn, and provide recommendations to improve retention.

---

## 🧠 Objective

SmartBank, a subsidiary of Lloyds, is facing declining retention among key customer segments such as young professionals and small business owners. This project uses **predictive analytics and machine learning** to identify at-risk customers and propose proactive interventions.

## 🔍 Key Tasks Completed

- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Feature Engineering
- ✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- ✅ Classification Model Development
- ✅ Model Evaluation using metrics like F1-score, AUC-ROC
- ✅ Submission of cleaned dataset and model evaluation report

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (EDA & Visualization)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **ROC AUC Score**
  
These metrics were used to ensure the model is effective in identifying true churn cases while minimizing false alarms.

---

## 📊 Insights from EDA

- High churn among younger customers and small business owners.
- Factors like **customer satisfaction**, **product usage**, and **tenure** are strong predictors of churn.
- Imbalanced class distribution handled using stratified splitting and evaluation focus on **F1-score** and **ROC AUC**.

## 💡 Suggestions for SmartBank

1. **Personalized Offers**: Target young professionals with tailored financial products.
2. **Satisfaction Campaigns**: Focus on feedback and satisfaction improvement for high-risk customers.
3. **Predictive Alerts**: Use the model output to trigger churn risk alerts in CRM systems.
